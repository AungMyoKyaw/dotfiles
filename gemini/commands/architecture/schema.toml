# Database Schema Design

User Request: {{args}}

Please parse the User Request to identify: [Database Type] [Complexity] [Project Description]
If not explicitly provided, infer them.

## Context

- Database Type: (from args, default: PostgreSQL)
- Complexity: (from args, default: advanced)
- Project Description: (from args, required)
- Current migrations: !{find . -name "*migration*" -o -name "schema.sql" | wc -l} files found

## Database Schema Design

Design comprehensive database architecture covering:

1. **Entity Relationship Modeling** for business domain representation
2. **Schema Optimization** for performance and scalability
3. **Data Integrity** for constraint validation and referential integrity
4. **Security Architecture** for data protection and access control
5. **Migration Strategy** for safe schema evolution
6. **Performance Tuning** for query optimization

## Design Components

**🏗️ Entity Relationship Design:**
- Core entity identification and modeling
- Relationship mapping (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
- Attribute definition and data type selection

**📊 Schema Architecture:**
- Table structure and organization
- Normalization vs denormalization strategy
- Index design for query optimization

**🔒 Security Architecture:**
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Access control and user permissions
- Audit logging and compliance tracking

## Output

Please provide:
1. **Schema Documentation** (ERD, Tables, Relationships)
2. **Migration Scripts** (SQL DDL)
3. **Performance Analysis**
4. **Security Guidelines**
