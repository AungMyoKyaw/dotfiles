# Git-flow Branch Creator

User Request: {{args}}

Please parse the User Request to identify: [Branch Type] [Branch Name] [Changes Source]
If not explicitly provided, infer them.

## Context

- Current branch: !{git branch --show-current}
- Modified files: !{git status --porcelain | wc -l} files

## Branch Creation Task

Execute intelligent Git-flow branch creation workflow covering:

1. **Branch Type Detection** (feature/release/hotfix based on context)
2. **Source Branch Selection** (develop/master based on branch type)
3. **Diff Analysis** for understanding current changes
4. **Change Classification** for intelligent naming
5. **Branch Name Generation** following Git-flow conventions
6. **Git-flow Branch Creation** with proper source branch
7. **Change Application** for smooth transition
8. **Validation** for successful Git-flow setup

## Git-flow Branch Types

- **feature/***: New features (branch from develop → merge to develop)
- **release/***: Prepare releases (branch from develop → merge to master + develop)
- **hotfix/***: Fix production issues (branch from master → merge to master + develop)

## Output

Provide the git commands to create the branch or perform the action.
