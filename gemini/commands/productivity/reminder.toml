# Smart Reminder CLI

User Request: {{args}}

## Task

Parse the user's natural language request and convert it into `reminder` CLI commands (using Apple Reminders via EventKit).

## Capabilities

- **Creation**: "remind me to buy milk", "add meeting tomorrow at 5pm"
- **Retrieval**: "show my reminders", "list tasks for today"
- **Management**: "complete the milk task", "delete the meeting"
- **Lists**: "create new list Work", "show all lists"
- **Stats**: "how many overdue items?"

## Context

You are acting as the parser. You should output the appropriate `reminder` CLI command(s) to execute, or if running in an environment where you can execute them directly, do so.

For the user: This command helps manage Apple Reminders via the command line.
