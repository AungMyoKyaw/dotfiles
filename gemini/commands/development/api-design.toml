# API Design

User Request: {{args}}

Please parse the User Request to identify: [API Type] [Complexity] [Purpose]
If not explicitly provided, infer them.

## Context

- API Type: (from args, default: REST)
- Complexity: (from args, default: advanced)
- Purpose: (from args, required)
- Current frameworks: !{find . -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "go.mod" -o -name "Cargo.toml" | head -3 || echo "No framework detected"}

## API Design Task

Design comprehensive API architecture covering:

1. **Architecture Selection** for optimal API patterns
2. **Security Design** with defense-in-depth strategies
3. **Performance Optimization** for scalability and speed
4. **Documentation Strategy** for developer experience
5. **Versioning Planning** for future evolution
6. **Integration Patterns** for system connectivity

## Design Components

**🏗️ Architecture Design:**
- Resource modeling and domain analysis
- Endpoint design and URL structure
- Request/response schema design

**🔒 Security Architecture:**
- Authentication mechanisms (JWT, OAuth2, API Keys)
- Authorization and role-based access control
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

**⚡ Performance Design:**
- Caching strategies
- Database optimization
- Load balancing

## Output

Please provide:
1. **API Specification**
2. **Security Architecture**
3. **Performance Strategy**
4. **Implementation Guide**
5. **Operations Guide**
