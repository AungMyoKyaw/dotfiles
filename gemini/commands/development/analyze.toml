# Code Analysis

User Request: {{args}}

Please parse the User Request to identify: [Analysis Focus] [Target Files/Directory]
If not explicitly provided, infer them.

## Context

- Current project structure: !{find . -type f -name "*.js" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.py" -o -name "*.go" -o -name "*.java" -o -name "*.rb" -o -name "*.php" -o -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.c" -o -name "*.cs" | head -20}
- Git status: !{git status --porcelain}
- Package manager detected: !{ls package.json 2>/dev/null && echo "npm/yarn" || ls requirements.txt 2>/dev/null && echo "pip" || ls Cargo.toml 2>/dev/null && echo "cargo" || ls go.mod 2>/dev/null && echo "go" || echo "unknown"}
- Branch info: !{git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "not a git repo"}

## Analysis Task

Perform comprehensive code analysis including:

1. **Architecture Assessment** - Overall design patterns and structure
2. **Code Quality Metrics** - Complexity, maintainability, technical debt
3. **Dependency Analysis** - Package relationships and potential issues
4. **Security Assessment** - Vulnerabilities and security best practices
5. **Performance Analysis** - Bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
6. **Scalability Evaluation** - How well the code handles growth
7. **Compliance Check** - Industry standards and best practices adherence

## Output

Provide:
- Detailed analysis report with specific findings
- Visual representations of code structure (when helpful)
- Priority list of issues to address
- Recommendations for improvements
- Estimated effort for addressing key issues
- Risk assessment for current implementation
