- **MacBook Pro 14-inch**: 1728×1117 pixels
- **MacBook Pro 16-inch**: 1920×1200 pixels

### 3. Screenshot Organization

For each device size:

- **File naming**: `{website-name}_{device-name}_{width}x{height}_{timestamp}.png`
- **Folder structure**: Organize by device category (iPhone/iPad/MacBook)
- **Saving files**: Use the `mv` command to move each screenshot file to the current repository after capture.
- **Full page capture**: Take both viewport and full-page screenshots when relevant
- **Quality settings**: Use high-quality PNG format for crisp detail

### 4. Testing Scenarios

#### Standard Testing

- Homepage screenshot
- Navigation menu testing (mobile vs desktop)
- Content area responsiveness
- Footer visibility and layout

#### Interactive Elements

- Form layouts and input fields
- Button sizes and accessibility
- Modal dialogs and overlays
- Dropdown menus and navigation

#### Performance Considerations

- Page load completion before screenshot
- Wait for dynamic content and animations
- Handle lazy-loaded images and content
- Capture both light and dark mode if supported

### 5. Reporting and Analysis

Generate a comprehensive report including:

#### Screenshot Summary

- Total screenshots captured: X
- Device categories tested: iPhone (X), iPad (X), MacBook (X)
- Authentication status: Success/Failed
- Any errors or issues encountered

#### Responsive Design Analysis

- **Layout consistency**: Compare across device sizes
- **Content visibility**: Identify cut-off or overlapping elements
- **Navigation usability**: Assess menu and button accessibility
- **Typography scaling**: Check text readability across sizes

#### Issue Identification

- **Critical issues**: Broken layouts, inaccessible content
- **Minor issues**: Suboptimal spacing, minor alignment problems
- **Recommendations**: Suggested improvements for better responsiveness

### 6. Advanced Features

#### Viewport Testing

- Test both portrait and landscape orientations for mobile devices
- Capture hover states where applicable (desktop)
- Test different zoom levels (100%, 125%, 150%)

#### Performance Metrics

- Page load times per device size
- Image optimization assessment
- Mobile-specific performance indicators

#### Accessibility Checks

- Color contrast verification
- Touch target size validation (minimum 44px)
- Text scalability testing

## Output Format

Provide results in this structure:

```

## Best Practices

1. **Systematic Approach**: Test devices in order from smallest to largest screen size
2. **Consistency**: Ensure same page state/scroll position for comparable screenshots
3. **Documentation**: Record any unusual behavior or device-specific issues
4. **Quality Assurance**: Verify all screenshots are clear, complete, and properly named
5. **Efficiency**: Batch similar device sizes to minimize navigation overhead

## Error Handling

- **Authentication failures**: Provide clear error messages and troubleshooting steps
- **Page load issues**: Implement retry logic with timeouts
- **Screenshot failures**: Log specific errors and continue with remaining devices
- **Network issues**: Handle timeouts and connection problems gracefully

**Important:**
You must use the Playwright MCP tool for all browser automation, device emulation, and screenshot capture steps.
Do not write or run any custom scripts—use only the Playwright MCP tool for the entire process.

Execute this testing protocol comprehensively to provide thorough Apple device compatibility analysis for any website.
