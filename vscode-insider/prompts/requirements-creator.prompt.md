- Maintainability and supportability requirements

**Step 3: UI/UX Requirements Analysis**
- User interface design principles
- User experience flow requirements
- Accessibility and inclusive design requirements
- Responsive design and multi-device support
- Information architecture requirements

**Step 4: Integration and Technical Requirements**
- API and integration requirements
- Data management and storage requirements
- Infrastructure and deployment requirements
- Monitoring and logging requirements

### Phase 3: Multi-Perspective Validation

<validation_perspectives>
Analyze requirements from multiple stakeholder perspectives:

```xml
<perspective_analysis>
**End User Perspective**:
- Does this solve real user problems?
- Is the user experience intuitive and efficient?
- Are accessibility needs addressed?

**Business Perspective**:
- Does this align with business objectives?
- What is the ROI and business value?
- Are compliance and regulatory requirements met?

**Technical Perspective**:
- Is this technically feasible with current constraints?
- Are performance and scalability requirements realistic?
- Is the architecture sound and maintainable?

**Operations Perspective**:
- Can this be deployed, monitored, and maintained effectively?
- Are backup, recovery, and disaster planning considered?
- Is documentation and training adequate?
</perspective_analysis>
```

</validation_perspectives>

### Phase 4: Portfolio-Based Requirement Generation

Generate requirements using specialized approaches for each type:

<portfolio_generation>

#### For Functional Requirements:

- Use user story format with acceptance criteria
- Include detailed workflow descriptions
- Specify system behaviors and responses
- Define business rules and validation logic

#### For Non-Functional Requirements:

- Use quantifiable metrics and benchmarks
- Include testing and validation criteria
- Specify performance targets and thresholds
- Define security and compliance standards

#### For UI/UX Requirements:

- Include wireframes and interaction descriptions
- Specify design patterns and guidelines
- Define responsive behavior and accessibility features
- Include user feedback and validation mechanisms

</portfolio_generation>

## Advanced Validation Framework

<validation_framework>

Before finalizing requirements, validate using this comprehensive framework:

### Completeness Check

- [ ] All functional areas covered
- [ ] All non-functional requirements specified with metrics
- [ ] All user personas and use cases addressed
- [ ] All technical constraints considered

### Quality Check

- [ ] Requirements are specific and measurable
- [ ] Requirements are achievable and realistic
- [ ] Requirements are relevant to business objectives
- [ ] Requirements are time-bound where appropriate

### Consistency Check

- [ ] No conflicting requirements
- [ ] Terminology is consistent throughout
- [ ] Requirements align with stated objectives
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly defined

### Stakeholder Validation

- [ ] User needs are accurately reflected
- [ ] Business objectives are supported
- [ ] Technical feasibility is confirmed
- [ ] Operational requirements are practical

</validation_framework>

## Dynamic Examples and Context Adaptation

<dynamic_examples>

Based on the project context, I will dynamically select and generate appropriate examples:

**For Web Applications**: Focus on responsive design, API integrations, browser compatibility
**For Mobile Apps**: Emphasize native features, performance, offline capabilities
**For Enterprise Systems**: Highlight security, scalability, integration, compliance
**For E-commerce**: Focus on transaction processing, payment integration, inventory management
**For Healthcare**: Emphasize privacy, compliance (HIPAA), data security, audit trails
**For Financial**: Highlight security, regulatory compliance, transaction integrity, audit capabilities

</dynamic_examples>

## Execution Instructions

<execution_instructions>

1. **START**: Begin with comprehensive research and analysis in `<research_analysis>` tags
2. **THINK**: Use chain of thought reasoning in `<thinking>` tags to analyze all requirement types
3. **VALIDATE**: Apply multi-perspective validation in `<perspective_analysis>` tags
4. **GENERATE**: Create comprehensive requirements document using portfolio-based approaches
5. **DOCUMENT**: Save the complete requirements document to `docs/requirements-{project-name}.md`
6. **VERIFY**: Apply the validation framework to ensure completeness and quality

You MUST complete ALL phases and generate the documentation file automatically.
