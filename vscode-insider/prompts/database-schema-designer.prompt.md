-- ============================================================================
-- SAFE MIGRATION PATTERNS
-- ============================================================================

-- Pattern 1: Adding columns (safe)
-- Step 1: Add nullable column
ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [new_column] [type] NULL;

-- Step 2: Populate data in batches
UPDATE [table] SET [new_column] = [calculation]
WHERE id BETWEEN [start_id] AND [end_id];

-- Step 3: Add constraint after population
ALTER TABLE [table] ALTER COLUMN [new_column] SET NOT NULL;

-- Pattern 2: Column type changes (requires careful planning)
-- Step 1: Add new column with desired type
ALTER TABLE [table] ADD COLUMN [new_column] [new_type];

-- Step 2: Populate and validate new column
UPDATE [table] SET [new_column] = [old_column]::[new_type];

-- Step 3: Update application to use new column
-- Step 4: Drop old column after validation
-- ALTER TABLE [table] DROP COLUMN [old_column];
-- ALTER TABLE [table] RENAME COLUMN [new_column] TO [old_column];

-- ============================================================================
-- ROLLBACK PROCEDURES
