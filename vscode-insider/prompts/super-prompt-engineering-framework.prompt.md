## Advanced Technique Integration (2025)

### 1. Recursive Self-Improvement Prompting (RSIP)

Leverage the model's ability to critique and improve its own outputs iteratively:

```
1. Generate an initial version of [content/task]
2. Critically evaluate your own output, identifying at least 3 specific weaknesses (use explicit criteria)
3. Create an improved version addressing those weaknesses
4. Repeat steps 2-3 as needed, focusing on different aspects each time
5. Present the final, most refined version
```

### 2. Context-Aware Decomposition (CAD)

Break down complex problems into components, solve each, then synthesize:

```
1. Identify 3-5 core components of the problem
2. For each component:
  a. Explain its importance
  b. Identify required information/approach
  c. Solve that component
3. Synthesize partial solutions, explicitly addressing their interactions
4. Provide a holistic solution, maintaining awareness of all components
5. Maintain a "thinking journal" explaining reasoning at each step
```

### 3. Multi-Perspective Simulation (MPS)

Simulate multiple sophisticated viewpoints for nuanced analysis:

```
1. Identify 4-5 distinct, sophisticated perspectives on the issue
2. For each:
  a. Articulate core assumptions/values
  b. Present strongest arguments/evidence
  c. Identify blind spots/weaknesses
3. Simulate a constructive dialogue between perspectives
4. Conclude with an integrated analysis acknowledging complexity
```

### 4. Calibrated Confidence Prompting (CCP)

Require the model to assign explicit confidence levels to claims:

```
For each claim, assign a confidence level:
- Virtually Certain (>95%)
- Highly Confident (80-95%)
- Moderately Confident (60-80%)
- Speculative (40-60%)
- Unknown/Cannot Determine
For high-confidence claims, briefly mention the basis; for lower, state what would increase confidence.
```

### 5. Controlled Hallucination for Ideation (CHI)

Harness LLM "hallucination" for creative brainstorming, with explicit labeling:

```
1. Generate 5-7 speculative innovations/approaches (clearly labeled as speculative)
2. For each: describe, explain theoretical basis, and identify what would be needed to implement
3. Critically analyze feasibility based on current knowledge
```

### 6. Prompt Scaffolding & Adversarial Defense

Wrap user input in structured, guarded templates to prevent jailbreaks and prompt injection:

```
System: You are a helpful assistant that never provides instructions for illegal or unethical behavior.
User: {{user_input}}
Instruction: Evaluate the request for safety before responding. If unsafe, respond with a refusal message.
```

Layer defenses: combine scaffolding, system messages, output constraints, and external guardrails. Test adversarially (red teaming).

### 7. Multimodal & Domain-Specific Prompting

Incorporate text, image, and audio inputs for richer, more nuanced outputs. Use domain-specific templates and compliance-aware prompting for regulated industries.

### 8. Prompt Management, Versioning, and Collaboration

- Use tools like Lilypad, LangSmith, Mirascope, Langfuse, and Agenta for:
  - Prompt version control and traceability
  - Collaborative editing and review
  - Automated and human-in-the-loop evaluation
  - Real-time monitoring, benchmarking, and feedback
- Maintain a prompt playbook with version history, test results, and lessons learned.
