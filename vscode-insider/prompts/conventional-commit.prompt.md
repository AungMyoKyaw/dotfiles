AUTONOMOUS CONVENTIONAL COMMIT WORKFLOW

This prompt is fully autonomous. It does not require or accept any manual input. Instead, it will:

1. Run `git status` and `git diff`/`git diff --cached` to detect all staged or unstaged changes in the repository.
2. Analyze the output to determine the true nature, scope, and impact of the changes.
3. Synthesize a conventional commit message (type, scope, description, body, footer) using constitutional AI and advanced Chain-of-Thought reasoning.
4. Execute the commit using the generated message, ensuring full compliance with the Conventional Commits specification.
5. Optionally push the commit to the current branch if desired.

No user description, file list, or manual input is needed. All information is derived from the current git state.

**CONSTITUTIONAL COMMIT PRINCIPLES:**

üîç **TRUTH-IN-HISTORY**: Create commit messages that accurately represent what actually changed and why
üéØ **CLARITY-FOR-COLLABORATION**: Write messages that enable team members to understand changes instantly
üõ°Ô∏è **SAFETY-THROUGH-STANDARDS**: Follow conventional commit standards to prevent confusion and enable automation
üíé **TRANSPARENCY-IN-INTENT**: Clearly communicate the purpose, scope, and impact of every change
üåä **EVOLUTION-FRIENDLY**: Structure commits to support semantic versioning and automated changelog generation
ü§ù **EMPATHY-FOR-REVIEWERS**: Consider how future developers (including yourself) will interpret this commit
üîÆ **FUTURE-PROOF-CONTEXT**: Provide enough context for changes to make sense months or years later
‚öñÔ∏è **ETHICAL-DOCUMENTATION**: Ensure commit messages contribute positively to project maintainability
</constitutional_commit_framework>

<chain_of_thought_commit_protocol>
**SYSTEMATIC COMMIT REASONING CHAIN:**

  </constitutional_commit_consciousness>

<autonomous_commit_processing>
**AUTONOMOUS CONVENTIONAL COMMIT WORKFLOW:**

1. **Detect changes:**

- Run `git status` to list changed, staged, and unstaged files.
- Run `git diff` and/or `git diff --cached` to see the actual code/content changes.

2. **Analyze changes:**

- For each file or hunk, determine the type of change (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, build, ci, chore, revert, etc.).
- Identify the scope (component, module, or area) from file paths or code context.
- Summarize the change in imperative mood (e.g., "add X", "fix Y").
- Detect breaking changes (look for major API changes, removals, or explicit BREAKING CHANGE comments).
- Identify related issues from code comments or branch names if possible.

3. **Synthesize commit message:**

- Format as per Conventional Commits:
  `<type>(<scope>): <imperative description>`
  Optionally add body and footer (BREAKING CHANGE, issue refs).

4. **Commit:**

- Stage all relevant files if not already staged (`git add ...`).
- Run `git commit -m "<generated message>"`.
- Optionally, run `git push` to update the remote branch.
