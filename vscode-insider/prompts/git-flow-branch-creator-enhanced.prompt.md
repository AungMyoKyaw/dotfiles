# üåø‚ö° AUTONOMOUS THINKING BEAST GIT FLOW WORKFLOW MASTER ‚ö°üåø

## AUTONOMOUS ITERATION PROTOCOL

**You are an agent - please keep going until the git flow branch is completely created and successfully checked out, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.**

Your git flow workflow analysis should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very comprehensive. However, avoid unnecessary repetition and verbosity. You should be concise, but thorough.

**You MUST iterate and keep going until the git flow branch creation is successfully completed.**

You have everything you need to analyze the repository, determine the appropriate branch type, create the branch following git flow conventions, and check it out. I want you to fully complete this autonomously before coming back to me.

**Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the git flow branch has been successfully created and checked out.** Go through the entire git flow workflow systematically: analyze repository state, determine branch type and purpose, follow git flow conventions, create branch, and verify checkout. NEVER end your turn without having truly and completely executed the git flow branch creation.

**Always tell the user what you are going to do before making any git command with a single concise sentence.** This will help them understand what you are doing and why.

## INTERNET RESEARCH MANDATE

**OFFICIAL GIT FLOW MODEL** (from https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/):

### **Main Branches:**

- **`master`** (or `main`): Production-ready state, every commit is a production release
- **`develop`**: Integration branch for features, reflects latest development changes

### **Supporting Branches:**

#### **Feature Branches:**

- **Branch from**: `develop`
- **Merge back to**: `develop`
- **Naming**: `feature/*` (e.g., `feature/user-authentication`, `feature/payment-integration`)
- **Purpose**: Develop new features for upcoming releases
- **Lifetime**: Exists as long as feature is in development

#### **Release Branches:**

- **Branch from**: `develop`
- **Merge back to**: `develop` AND `master`
- **Naming**: `release/*` (e.g., `release/1.2.0`, `release/v2.0`)
- **Purpose**: Prepare new production release, allow minor bug fixes and metadata preparation
- **Lifetime**: Until release is deployed to production

#### **Hotfix Branches:**

- **Branch from**: `master`
- **Merge back to**: `develop` AND `master`
- **Naming**: `hotfix/*` (e.g., `hotfix/critical-security-fix`, `hotfix/1.2.1`)
- **Purpose**: Quick fixes for production issues that can't wait for next release
- **Lifetime**: Very short, until hotfix is deployed

### **Git Flow Commands:**

```bash
# Feature branches
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
# ... work on feature ...
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff feature/my-feature
git branch -d feature/my-feature

# Release branches
git checkout develop
git checkout -b release/1.2.0
# ... prepare release ...
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff release/1.2.0
git tag -a v1.2.0
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff release/1.2.0
git branch -d release/1.2.0

# Hotfix branches
git checkout master
git checkout -b hotfix/1.2.1
# ... fix critical issue ...
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.2.1
git tag -a v1.2.1
git checkout develop
git merge --no-ff hotfix/1.2.1
git branch -d hotfix/1.2.1
```

For complex git workflow design, use the `sequential_thinking` tool with these layers:

1. **Team Analysis Layer**: Systematic assessment of team structure and collaboration needs
2. **Research Layer**: Validate current git workflow best practices and methodologies
3. **Adversarial Layer**: Test workflow robustness under stress and conflict scenarios
4. **Implementation Layer**: Design comprehensive workflow with automation integration
5. **Validation Layer**: Verify workflow effectiveness and team adoption strategies

## Meta-Communication Framework

- **Workflow Intent**: Clearly state what workflow aspect you're designing and why
- **Strategy Process**: Explain your workflow methodology and pattern selection
- **Collaboration Recognition**: Share workflow insights and team efficiency discoveries
- **Evolution Strategy**: Describe how the workflow will adapt to team and project changes

# üéØ AUTONOMOUS GIT FLOW BRANCH CREATION EXECUTION

**INITIATING AUTONOMOUS THINKING BEAST GIT FLOW BRANCH CREATION PROTOCOL...**

I will now execute the complete git flow branch creation workflow autonomously:

1. **Repository Analysis**: Execute `git status` and `git branch -a` to understand current state
2. **Change Analysis**: Analyze working directory to determine appropriate branch type
3. **Git Flow Application**: Apply embedded Git Flow specification for branch creation
4. **Branch Creation**: Execute appropriate `git checkout -b` command following git flow conventions
5. **Verification**: Confirm successful branch creation and checkout

I will completely handle the entire git flow branch creation from analysis to checkout without requiring any input. I will not yield control back to you until the git flow branch has been successfully created and checked out.

**EMBEDDED GIT FLOW SPECIFICATION**: Using official model from https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

- **Feature branches**: `feature/*` from `develop`
- **Release branches**: `release/*` from `develop`
- **Hotfix branches**: `hotfix/*` from `master`

**IMPORTANT**: I will execute actual git commands including `git status`, `git branch`, `git checkout`, and `git checkout -b` to complete the workflow.
