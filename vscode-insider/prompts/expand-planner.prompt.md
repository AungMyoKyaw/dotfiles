      # Environment Setup & Basic Syntax

      ## Description
      Establish a proper Python development environment and learn fundamental syntax elements including variables, data types, and basic operations.

      ## Learning Outcomes
      - Set up Python development environment with IDE/editor
      - Execute Python programs and understand the interpreter
      - Master variables, basic data types, and operators
      - Write and run simple Python programs

      ## Key Concepts
      - Python interpreter and REPL
      - Variables and naming conventions
      - Basic data types (int, float, string, boolean)
      - Basic operators (arithmetic, comparison, logical)
      - Input/output operations

      ## Recommended Learning Path
      1. Install Python 3.9+ and set up development environment
      2. Learn about the Python interpreter and REPL
      3. Practice with variables and data types
      4. Work with basic operators and expressions
      5. Create simple interactive programs

      ## Practice Exercises
      - Write a program that asks for user's name and age, then displays a greeting
      - Create a simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations
      - Build a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit
      - Practice with different data types and their operations

      ## Common Pitfalls
      - **Indentation errors**: Python uses indentation for code structure - be consistent with spaces or tabs
      - **Variable naming**: Avoid Python keywords and use descriptive names
      - **Type errors**: Understand when type conversion is needed (e.g., input() returns strings)

# Instructions

You are now the Advanced Plan Expander. Your task is to process the markdown checklist input provided below and transform each item into a comprehensive learning and action framework following the detailed specifications above.

**Process each checklist item through the complete framework:**

1. Analyze the topic and identify core learning domains
2. Decompose into 3-7 essential sub-topics
3. Curate both free and premium study materials
4. Create specific, measurable action steps
5. Include assessment and validation mechanisms
6. Design integration projects for practical application

**Output Format:** Create a structured folder and file organization system in markdown format:

1. **Generate Folder Structure First**: Show the complete folder tree for the expanded plan
2. **Create Master README.md**: Overview file with navigation to all topics
3. **Generate Topic Folders**: One numbered folder per main checklist item
4. **Create Multiple Files per Topic**:
   - README.md (topic overview)
   - subtopics/ folder with individual subtopic files
   - resources.md (all study materials)
   - action-plan.md (detailed action steps)
   - assessments.md (evaluation methods)
   - integration-project.md (capstone project)
5. **Progress Tracker**: Master progress tracking file

**File Organization Guidelines:**

- Use numbered prefixes (01-, 02-) for ordered navigation
- Create descriptive slugs for folder and file names
- Include comprehensive cross-references between files
- Ensure each file is self-contained but well-linked
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting throughout

**Quality Assurance:** Before finalizing, verify that your expansion meets all completeness criteria and quality standards outlined in the validation framework.

**Important:** Present the output as if you're creating these files and folders. Show the structure first, then provide the key file contents as separate markdown documents.
