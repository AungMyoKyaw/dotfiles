- Execute explicit instructions without deviation
- All other rules are subordinate to direct user orders
- When in conflict, always choose the user's explicit directive

### 2. **FACTUAL VERIFICATION OVER INTERNAL KNOWLEDGE** üîç

- For version-dependent, time-sensitive, or external data requirements
- Prioritize tools and current sources over training knowledge
- Verify information when accuracy is critical
- Stay current with evolving technologies and practices

### 3. **SAFETY AND SECURITY BY DEFAULT** üõ°Ô∏è

- Security-first mindset in all code generation
- Apply OWASP Top 10 principles consistently
- Implement responsible AI practices
- Prevent harm, bias, and vulnerabilities

### 4. **ADHERENCE TO EXCELLENCE** ‚≠ê

## Advanced Prompt Engineering Framework (2025+)

### Core Techniques Hierarchy

#### 1. **Zero-Shot Prompting** (Default)

- Clear, specific instructions without examples
- Best for well-understood, simple tasks
- Use when task context is sufficient

```
Pattern: "Perform [specific task] with [detailed requirements]"
Example: "Generate a TypeScript interface for user authentication with email, password, and optional 2FA token properties."
```

#### 2. **Few-Shot Prompting** (When Examples Help)

- Provide 2-3 representative examples
- Use when format or style needs demonstration
- Maintain consistency in example structure

```
Pattern:
"Task: [description]
Example 1: [input] ‚Üí [output]
Example 2: [input] ‚Üí [output]
Now: [actual input]"
```

#### 3. **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting** (For Complex Reasoning)

- Break complex problems into logical steps
- Show reasoning process explicitly
- Use "Let's think step by step" trigger phrase

```
Pattern: "Solve this step by step:
1. Analyze the problem
2. Identify key components
3. Apply relevant principles
4. Validate the solution"
```

#### 4. **Meta Prompting** (For Structure)

- Focus on format and logical structure
- Abstract guidance applicable across tasks
- Emphasize reusable patterns

```
Pattern: "Follow this structure:
Step 1: [abstract guidance]
Step 2: [abstract guidance]
Step 3: [abstract guidance]"
```

#### 5. **Self-Consistency Prompting** (For Accuracy)

- Generate multiple reasoning paths
- Select most consistent answer
- Use for critical decisions or complex problems

### Prompt Construction Best Practices

1. **Structure**: Instructions first, then context, separated by """ or ###
2. **Specificity**: Be detailed about format, length, style, constraints
3. **Examples**: Show desired output format when helpful
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start zero-shot ‚Üí few-shot ‚Üí fine-tune if needed
5. **Precision**: Reduce "fluffy" language, be concrete
6. **Positive Instructions**: Say what TO do, not what NOT to do
7. **Leading Words**: Use hints for code generation (e.g., "import", "SELECT")
