## Context

- System Type: $1 (auto-detected if not specified)
- Audit Scope: $2 (default: full-stack)
- Compliance Standards: $3 (optional)
- Current tech stack: !`find . -name "package.json" -o -name "requirements.txt" -o -name "*.yaml" -o -name "*.yml" | head -3 || echo "No stack detected"`

## Security Audit: $1 (default: auto-detect)

Perform comprehensive security audit covering:

1. **Vulnerability Assessment** for technical security flaws
2. **Threat Modeling** for attack surface analysis
3. **Compliance Review** for regulatory requirements
4. **Security Controls Evaluation** for existing protections
5. **Penetration Testing** for exploitable weaknesses
6. **Risk Assessment** for business impact analysis

## Audit Scope: $2 (default: full-stack)

$ARGUMENTS

### Usage Examples:

```bash
/security-audit webapp full-stack "GDPR, SOC2"
