# Emacs Configuration

This is a clean, minimal Emacs configuration designed for learning Emacs from scratch.

## Structure

- `init.el` - Main configuration file with essential settings
- `early-init.el` - Early initialization (optional, for performance tweaks)
- `custom.el` - Custom settings (auto-generated by Emacs)

## Features

- **Clean UI**: No menu bar, tool bar, or scroll bars for distraction-free editing
- **Line Numbers**: Shows line numbers in all buffers
- **Theme**: Uses the beautiful Catppuccin Mocha theme (auto-installed)
- **Vim Editing**: Evil mode for Vim/Neovim-like keybindings
- **Basic Editing**: Spaces instead of tabs (2-width), auto-close brackets/quotes
- **Helpful Keybindings**: Improved buffer list with `ibuffer`
- **Learning-Friendly**: Welcome message with basic commands

## Getting Started

1. Run the `link_dotfiles.sh` script to create symlinks
2. Start Emacs: `emacs`
3. Use Vim keybindings for navigation and editing (thanks to Evil mode)
4. Follow the built-in tutorial: `M-x help-with-tutorial`
5. Explore commands with: `C-h k` (describe key) or `C-h f` (describe function)

## Vim Keybindings

The configuration includes Evil mode, providing Vim/Neovim-like keybindings:

- **Normal mode**: `hjkl` for navigation, `i` for insert, `:` for commands
- **Visual mode**: `v` for character selection, `V` for line selection
- **Insert mode**: Standard text editing with `Escape` to return to normal mode
- **Evil Collection**: Enhanced Vim bindings for many Emacs modes

## Recommended Packages for Learning

As you get comfortable, consider adding these packages:

- `ivy` + `counsel` - Better completion and navigation
- `which-key` - Shows available keybindings
- `magit` - Git integration
- `company` - Auto-completion
- `flycheck` - Syntax checking
- `projectile` - Project management

## Theme Customization

The configuration uses Catppuccin Mocha theme by default. To switch between flavors:

```elisp
;; Available flavors: 'latte (light), 'frappe, 'macchiato, 'mocha (dark)
(setq catppuccin-flavor 'frappe)
(catppuccin-reload)
```

## Customization

Add your personal customizations to `init.el` or create separate files in the `lisp/` directory for organization.
