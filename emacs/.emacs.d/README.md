# Emacs Configuration

This is a clean, minimal Emacs configuration designed for learning Emacs from scratch.

## Structure

- `init.el` - Main configuration file with essential settings
- `early-init.el` - Early initialization (optional, for performance tweaks)
- `custom.el` - Custom settings (auto-generated by Emacs)

## Features

- **Clean UI**: No menu bar, tool bar, or scroll bars for distraction-free editing
- **Line Numbers**: Shows line numbers in all buffers
- **Theme**: Uses the beautiful Catppuccin Mocha theme (auto-installed)
- **Vim Editing**: Evil mode for Vim/Neovim-like keybindings
- **Tmux-Style Window Management**: C-a prefix for consistent navigation between tmux and Emacs
- **Basic Editing**: Spaces instead of tabs (2-width), auto-close brackets/quotes
- **Helpful Keybindings**: Improved buffer list with `ibuffer`
- **Learning-Friendly**: Welcome message with basic commands

## Getting Started

1. Run the `link_dotfiles.sh` script to create symlinks
2. Start Emacs: `emacs`
3. Use Vim keybindings for navigation and editing (thanks to Evil mode)
4. Use tmux-style C-a prefix for window management (consistent with your tmux setup)
5. Follow the built-in tutorial: `M-x help-with-tutorial`
6. Explore commands with: `C-h k` (describe key) or `C-h f` (describe function)

## Vim Keybindings

The configuration includes Evil mode, providing Vim/Neovim-like keybindings:

- **Normal mode**: `hjkl` for navigation, `i` for insert, `:` for commands
- **Visual mode**: `v` for character selection, `V` for line selection
- **Insert mode**: Standard text editing with `Escape` to return to normal mode
- **Evil Collection**: Enhanced Vim bindings for many Emacs modes

## Tmux-Style Window Management

This configuration uses `C-a` as the primary prefix for window management, matching tmux's default behavior for consistent muscle memory:

### Navigation

- `C-a h/j/k/l` - Navigate between windows (left/down/up/right)

### Window Splitting

- `C-a |` - Split window vertically
- `C-a -` - Split window horizontally

### Window Control

- `C-a z` - Zoom current window (toggle - maximizes/restores layout)
- `C-a 1` - Close other windows (make current fill screen)
- `C-a x` - Close current window
- `C-a c` - Create new frame
- `C-a ,` - Rename current buffer

### Buffer Management

- `C-a s` - Buffer switcher (ibuffer)
- `C-a w` - Switch to next window
- `C-a n` - Next buffer
- `C-a p` - Previous buffer

### Utilities

- `C-a a` - Go to beginning of line (replaces default Emacs C-a)
- `C-a d` - Detach/suspend frame
- `C-a [` - Paste from clipboard
- `C-a ]` - Copy to clipboard

**Note**: These shortcuts are designed to match tmux's `tmux-pain-control` plugin behavior, making switching between tmux and Emacs seamless.

## Recommended Packages for Learning

As you get comfortable, consider adding these packages:

- `ivy` + `counsel` - Better completion and navigation
- `which-key` - Shows available keybindings
- `magit` - Git integration
- `company` - Auto-completion
- `flycheck` - Syntax checking
- `projectile` - Project management

## Theme Customization

The configuration uses Catppuccin Mocha theme by default. To switch between flavors:

```elisp
;; Available flavors: 'latte (light), 'frappe, 'macchiato, 'mocha (dark)
(setq catppuccin-flavor 'frappe)
(catppuccin-reload)
```

## Customization

Add your personal customizations to `init.el` or create separate files in the `lisp/` directory for organization.
